## Soundtrack

Soundtrack is an app that uses classifcation methods to extend Spotify playlist categories to previously uncategorized songs.  So if your favorite artist doesn't show up on Spotify's 'Chill', 'Workout', or other playlists, Soundtrack can help create the right mix of their music to fit your needs.

Files include data collection, modeling, database creation helpers, as well as the app's design (via Flask).
